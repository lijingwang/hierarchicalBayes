This paper is under review at Water Resources Research. 

Examples of hierarchical Bayesian framework:

- Case1, linear forward modeling, volume averaging: case1_HierarchicalBayesian_volumeAveraging.ipynb

- Case2, non-linear forward modeling, pumping test: case2_LocalInversion_pumpingtest.ipynb

Example datasets are too large to be hosted on GitHub. You can download our example datasets from this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15DhGUQN6phI0hMmR3mL_c1OL7db5pmd7?usp=sharing). Or you can generate datasets using MC_case1_linear_forward_volume_averaging.py or MC_case2_nonlinear_forward_pumpingtest.py in /utils.
